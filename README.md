- 👋 Hi, I’m @vincentswiderski
- 👀 I’m interested in data driven thinking and technologies that can make it possible.
- 🌱 I left my previous company (Airbus) to become a student again and learn data science at DSTI, which is very exciting to me.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on data science projects but I guess this will happen in my studies.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on GitHub or Linkedin!
